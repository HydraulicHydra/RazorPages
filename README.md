# RazorPages
In my opinion, using Razor is less complicated than utilizing MVC because it requires fewer things to all work together
in tandem, and fewer pages in general.
The phrase 'Everything old is new again' is applied in the way it takes the older html format, and reinvigorates it
with the relatively much newer C# language, making something old modern.
